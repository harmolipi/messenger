### Functionality

This is the [Messenger](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/rails_programming/mailers_advanced_topics/actioncable_lesson.md) project, where I make a interface using websockets through ActionCable that allows users to send and immediately display messages to each other.

### Thoughts

This last unit, regarding ActionCable, definitely felt pretty complex and was difficult to wrap my head around. Putting it all together in this project helped though - especially when it came to the JS parts, which are a bit rusty for me. It eventually made sense though, and I think that if I need to use ActionCable in the future (hopefully I will - it seems like there's a lot you can do with it), I should be able to refer back to this project to remember what I need to do. Look forward to making more cool projects with this though!

God bless.
